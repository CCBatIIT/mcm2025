# MCM 2025 Website

This is the website of David Minh's academic research group at Illinois Tech.

The website is hosted by [GitHub pages](https://ccbatiit.github.io). GitHub also contains the [website source](https://github.com/CCBatIIT/CCBatIIT.github.io).

It was adapted from the Allan Lab
[[website](https://www.allanlab.org/)] [[code](https://github.com/allanlab/allanlab)]. The Allan lab released the website under the MIT license and provided nice documentation on how to modify their website. Thank you!

The template was also modified to include a blog, as described in [a guide to GitHub pages](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). I'm hoping to use the blog to post findings or opinions that others may find valuable or interesting but are too small for research papers.
