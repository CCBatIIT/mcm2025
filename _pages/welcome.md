The biennial International Conference on Monte Carlo Methods and Applications (MCM) (formerly IMACS Seminar on Monte Carlo Methods) is one of the most prominent conference series devoted to research on stochastic simulation and Monte Carlo methods.

<!--This 15th edition aims to cover traditional topics of MCM conferences (Computational statistical physics, Quasi Monte Carlo methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo in high dimension, Multilevel methods, Rare events simulation, Stochastic gradient and other stochastic optimization methodsâ€¦) as well as emerging topics coming from applications and from artificial intelligence as: Generative models, Experimental design in Uncertainty Quantification, Monte Carlo simulations and High Performance computing, Reinforcement learning and control, Statistical learning and Monte Carlo sampling, Economic and industrial applications (Deeptech, finance, medicine, climate risks for instance).
