# Conference Location

MCM 2025 will take place in Chicago. Greater Chicago is home to several research universities and two United States Department of Energy research laboratories.  Chicago is a major transportation hub, which will facilitate scholars from all over the world coming together to share the latest developments in Monte Carlo methods.

The conference will be held at Hermann Hall at the Mies campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology, which is situated a few miles south of downtown and accessible by public transportation. See [directions to IIT](https://www.iit.edu/about/campus-information/mies-campus) and the [IIT Campus Map](https://www.iit.edu/about/campus-information/mies-campus/mies-campus-map).
